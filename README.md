# 30-Day Video Game Music Challenge

The challenge is simple: each day, look at the corresponding category in the calendar below, and pick a video game song you're familiar with that fits into said category.

My picks and corresponding commentary can be found in the `writeups/` folder. I did "Ultra Hard Mode": no repeat games _or_ franchises.

These were written as part of a community activity on the _Holy Heck I Really Like Love Live_ Discord server. [Come join us and share your own picks!](https://discord.gg/gaDkfSm)
