Yes, I'm one of the fan casualties of Sun & Moon's excessive railroading and handholdiness. I just couldn't put up with the excessive but boring dialogue and shelved the game after finishing the Trainers' School. I'll probably pick it back up if I ever get the itch to play Pokémon again, but that probably won't be any time soon. That said, I have to give some credit to the Trainers' School theme for keeping me playing just a few hours longer. The piano's bright and jazzy ditty strikes a great balance between careful optimism and explorative freedom, the same feelings I get during my best learning experiences. Likewise, the hand claps are like the best of teachers, regularly congratulating you on your success while urging you forward at the same time. It almost makes me nostalgic for school. Almost.
