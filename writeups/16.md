The GBA port of *A Link to the Past* was my cherished introduction to the *Zelda* franchise. It came with the original *Four Swords*, which I sadly never got to play because no one else I knew had the game. Despite that, I'm so, *so* glad Nintendo included it in the same game pak because it allowed this awesome 16-bit rendition of the original *Legend of Zelda* title theme to exist on the "Select a Game" screen. Although there have been countless official and fan arrangements of the main theme with great instrument samples, and even live performances, this rendition will always be my favourite because there's just a certain *je ne sais quois* to the 16-bit sound. I think it's because the soundfont strikes a perfect balance between sounding epic and exciting while also still sounding playful and inviting, which I feel matches the upbeat sense of adventure at the heart of *Zelda*. The lower bass synth is pumping and urgent but also somewhat dance-y, and the 16-bit choir sounds intimate and down-to-earth in contrast to how actual choirs tend to add a dramatic flair. It all serves to remind you that the epic adventure you're about to embark on is still a game meant for you to enjoy, and that just feels so endearing to me.
