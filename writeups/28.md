Few of my childhood memories can match the nostalgia of hearing the opening swell of *Hikari*'s orchestral version set against the passage of text above. *Kingdom Hearts* has changed in so many ways since then, but that doesn't take anything away from the absolute wonder and heart that lies at the core of the first game. I still tear up during the chorus beginning at 1:50, as I can perfectly recall the attract mode cutscene bits that go with it, and how they showcased a huge, inviting set of worlds ready for me to explore. (Sora jumping off Captain Hook's ship and flying away to freedom will always stick with me for how it makes my heart soar alongside the swell of the strings.) Overall, I can't think of another song that connects so strongly to that childhood sense of adventure and crystallizes it into pure sentimentality. Thank you, Yoko Shimomura.
