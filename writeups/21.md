The divination séances are a neat concept in *Spirit of Justice*. You get to watch the last few seconds of a victim's life and read what sensations they were experiencing at the time. The idea is to compare what you're watching to the sensations, then pinpoint a precise area in the victim's field of vision that contradicts assumptions about the circumstances in which the victim was killed.

In practice, however, this ends up being more frustrating than not due to ambiguity, the sheer number of options, and having to do pixel hunting in a moving video. One particularly egregious section had me stumped for 2-3 days. It's a shame the music brings back these feelings so strongly for me that I can't even bring myself to analyze it, as there's some cool stuff going on there and it's a uniquely minimalist atmospheric track for *Ace Attorney*. The highlight for me would probably be the low, bassy string plucks sprinkled all throughout the song.
