Instead of picking music from a niche or underrated game, I went with a song from a well-known game that often gets overlooked by other, more popular songs. Everyone knows their Snake Man Stage and their Spark Man Stage and their Shadow Man Stage, but I barely see any discussions or covers of poor old Gemini Man's tune. It didn't even get a Smash remix! That's a travesty, as this song does such a good job of sounding weird and kinda alien like he is, while still being an energetic bop like the rest of Mega Man 3's soundtrack.
