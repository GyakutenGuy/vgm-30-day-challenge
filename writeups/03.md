This is the overworld theme for a cute little GBA adventure game built on the same engine as Link's Awakening. Not much to say about this one other than that it's really cute, ridiculously catchy, and encapsulates a blend of haughtiness, pluckiness, and endearing that describes Prince Richard perfectly (seriously, the 8-bit trumpet practically _is_ Richard's voice). I was really happy to hear an arrangement of the melody pop up in Link's Awakening HD.
