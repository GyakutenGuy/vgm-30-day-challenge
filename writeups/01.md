So you start up the game and hear all these high-tech synths and effects. "Okay," you say, "This is definitely *digi*mon." But then, 0:10 drops and _BAM_ you're smacked over the head with pure Danganronpa craziness. I initially had my doubts about Masafumi Takada handling this game, but that lasted all of a few seconds. The descending piano line (very much a Danganronpa carryover) is both ominous and thought-provoking, which fits the game's detective story as well as the slowly-unravelling mystery as you find out more and more about the digital world. But what really sold me are the guitar and sax: they're both definitely synthetic, but they wail out like the roars of some monster. These roars simultaneously feel like the call to action from a friend, as well as the intimidating howl from a dangerous beast. And what better way to describe Digimon, digital beings who could be either friend or foe?
